# Arts by Bela - Testing Protocol

[Demo of Website](https://arts-by-bela.herokuapp.com/)

Refer to [Main project file](README.md) for further detail.

## Code validation

- [W3C CSS Jigsaw Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)
- [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input)
- [JSHint Validator](https://jshint.com/)
- [Python Validator](http://pep8online.com/) 

All CSS, JS and Python files were validated and returned no errors at the time of this entry.
Auto generated Python files, as "app/migrations/*.py" were not validated as they are not created manually.

The HTML templates were tested by direct input of the rendered website. The errors returned were related to Materialize / Stripe auto generated code. No written custom HTML returned errors. HTML content emails were not validated as there was inline styling being auto-gerenerated from django-inlinecss.

The following templates and scenarios were tested:

- index.html
- showcase.html - with and without artworks on database
- personal_work.html
- profile.html - with and without commissions on database
- new_commission.html
- edit_commission.html
- payment.html 
- payment_success.html
- wip_details.html - as client and as artist with and without wip_illustration/client_comment
- artwork_details.html - as client and as artist with and without final_illustration/client_review
- artwork_details.html - as personal work of artist

## Manual testing of features

The deployed Heroku website was viewed on  desktops screens (21 and 13 inches) and also on Motorola G6 Play device.

The website was tested with Google Chrome (v.93.0), Mozilla Firefox (v.91) and Microsoft Edge (v.93) browsers.

On mobile, it was viewed with Google Chrome application v.93.0 on Android 9.

The Developer Tools of Google Chrome (v.93) on desktop was used to verify responsiveness on different devices. 

**Testing notes**:
a - At least 2 different Resolutions and 2 different Sizes have to be set on the database.
b - The tester needs access to a superuser account. This will be referred on the Test Steps as Artist Account.
c - The tester needs access to an email to create a regular user account. [TempMail](https://temp-mail.org/en/) can be used for this, but the session should remain open throughout the testing. This account will be referred on the Test Steps as Client Account.
d - The test is designed to follow the website workflow, ideally all test steps should be executed consecutively.

   ### Known issues

- The files are only open on a new tab, instead of downloaded from the S3 bucket on the deployed environment. To fix this issue, the Content-Disposition of the file has to be set at custom storage classes. This was not implemented to avoid data transfer fees. For further information, refer to [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43208401/add-dynamic-content-disposition-for-file-namesamazon-s3-in-python).
- When adding images on Mozilla, files with extension .jfif were not available for selection. Microsoft Edge and Google Chrome allowed selection and upload of those files.
