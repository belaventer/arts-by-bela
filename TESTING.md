- [W3C CSS Jigsaw Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)
- [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input)
- [JSHint Validator](https://jshint.com/)
- [Python Validator](http://pep8online.com/) 

All CSS, JS and Python files were validated and returned no errors at the time of this entry.

- showcase.html - with and without artworks on database
- personal_work.html
- profile.html - with and without commissions on database
- new_commission.html

## Manual testing of features

The deployed Heroku website was viewed on  desktops screens (21 and 13 inches) and also on Motorola G6 Play device.

<!-- The website was tested with Google Chrome (v.91.0), Mozilla Firefox (v.89) and Microsoft Edge (v.91) browsers.

On mobile, it was viewed with Google Chrome application v.91.0 on Android 9.

The Developer Tools of Google Chrome (v.91) on desktop was used to verify responsiveness on different devices. -->

   ### Known issues
- The files are only open on a new tab, instead of downloaded from the S3 bucket on the deployed enviroment. To fix this issue, the Content-Disposition of the file has to be set at custom storage classes. This was not implemented to avoid data tranfer fees. For further information, refer to [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43208401/add-dynamic-content-disposition-for-file-namesamazon-s3-in-python).
